# Practicing functions in Python with guessing games
1. guessgame.py - pick a number, 0, 1, or 2 to correctly guess the randomly chosen number.
2. guessnumber1.py - pick a number between 1 and 100, the computer will tell you if your guess is too high or too low compared to the randomly chosen number. Keep guessing until you get it just right. 
3. guessnumber2.py - pick a number in your head, between 1 and 100 and the computer will try to correctly guess your number. Tell the computer if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. 
4. hangman.py - to play this game, you will also need to save the words.py file (the "word bank"). Correctly guess the word, letter by letter. Keep on playing to correctly guess more words. As a hint, the theme here is "food".
